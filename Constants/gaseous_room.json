Atop a few tables along the north wall are a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping.  You can now visibly see a locked glass display case that contains a key.  There appears to be a puzzle or maze of some sort admidst the clutter, perhaps this will help open the display case.\n\nThe only door in the room is on the west end, which leads to the Torch Corridor.",
