In particular there is a distict mirror that is smaller than the rest of them towards the north end of the hall where it looks a little darker.  There is immediate danger in the air and you have to make sure you are equipped with the right weapon, otherwise you will not make it past this room.  There are stairs on the south end of the room leading to the Southeast Corridor.  There is a door on the north end of the room that takes you to the Torch Corridor.",
