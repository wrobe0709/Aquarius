    "long_description": "At first glance there is a short hall in which there is an observable skylight above the ceiling; the moon is visible.  The closer you walk towards the end of the hall to the far east end it gradually seems to get darker.  At the end of the short hall when you turn the corner to a longer hall, the walls are covered in mold spotted draperies.  In between two sections of drapes on the right wall, there is a switch.  At the end of this longer hall looks like there is a staircase that leads down to a lower level.",
