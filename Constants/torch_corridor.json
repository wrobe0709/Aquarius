When you hang a right at the corner towards the east end, there is a torch that looks different from all the rest; the material is more of a blue color rather than brown.  There is a door on the south end of the corridor which takes you back to the Great Hall.  There is a doorway on the east end of the corridor that takes you to the Gaseous Room.  There is a door on the north end of the corridor that takes you to the Northeast Corridor.",
