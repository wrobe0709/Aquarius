There are a few niches in the wall which each contain a clay urn placed on the floor.  There is a horrendous overwhelming stench.  In the far northwest corner, there lies a single skeleton dressed in aged clothing and rusted armor.  On his head is a rusted, yet sturdy helmet.  There is a door on the east end of the corridor, that takes you to the Shadow Corridor.  There is a door on the south end of the corridor, that takes you to the Diamond Room.",
